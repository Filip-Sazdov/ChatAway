# ChatAway
Chat App built using React Native, Gifted Chat UI, and Google Firebase.

The app lets you communicate, take and share pictures as well as share your location with your friends.

## Use

To be able to use the app, one needs to download or clone this repository, and have Expo Go installed on one's mobile device.

An optional download is Android Studio.(Android Studio is a beneficial piece of software which enables various mobile device emulators/simulators to run the App on, but is not really essential to see the App work.)

The next step is to run `npm install` in one's preferred terminal which will install all the dependencies required to run the app.

Then, running `expo start` in the terminal will start the metro-builder/webpack-server that enables the app to run. (If you have Android Studio installed, simply run `expo start --android` while you also have an emulator running)

Lastly, scan the QR code generated by the metro-builder with Expo Go and the app will run on your mobile device.

Enjoy using the App.

## Database Configuration

To be able to use a personal instance of Google Firabase, one would need an account with Google Firebase and a set of configuration data enabled when one creates a new project with Firestore.

Substitute this data with the one found in the `const firebaseConfig`.
